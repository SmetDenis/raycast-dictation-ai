# Dictation AI

A powerful Raycast extension that converts speech to text and formats the output using OpenAI's advanced language models. Perfect for quick dictation, note-taking, and professional communication with intelligent text formatting.

> **Note**: This project is a fork of [Advanced Speech to Text](https://www.raycast.com/inakitajes/advanced-speech-to-text) by I√±aki Tajes. Special thanks to I√±aki for creating the original extension that served as the foundation for this enhanced version.

```

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

- **Dictate Command** (`src/dictate.tsx`): Main recording and transcription workflow with state management
- **Recording History** (`src/recording-history.tsx`): History management interface
- **Audio Recorder Hook** (`src/hooks/useAudioRecorder.ts`): SoX integration for recording

### Audio System

- Uses SoX (Sound eXchange) for cross-platform recording
- Records in WAV format (16kHz, mono, 16-bit) optimized for Whisper
- Automatic SoX detection across common installation paths: `/usr/local/bin/sox`, `/opt/homebrew/bin/sox`, `/usr/bin/sox`
- Audio validation (1KB minimum, 25MB maximum) and temporary file management

### API Integration

- **OpenAI**: Single provider for both transcription and text formatting
- Configurable base URL supports OpenAI-compatible APIs
- Robust error handling for API rate limits, authentication, and quota issues
- Temperature setting affects both transcription and formatting

### File Management

- Temporary audio files stored in `~/Library/Application Support/com.raycast.macos/extensions/dictation-ai/temp`
- Automatic cleanup of files older than 24 hours
- No persistent data storage beyond temporary audio files
- File validation and size limit enforcement

### Clipboard Operations

Advanced clipboard management with multiple paste behaviors:
- Direct paste with fallback to copy
- Smart routing based on user preferences
- HUD notifications for user feedback
- Error handling with graceful degradation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**SoX not installed**
```bash
# Install via Homebrew
brew install sox
```

**Recording not working**
- Check microphone permissions in System Preferences
- Ensure SoX is installed and accessible in PATH
- Try different microphone input sources
- Verify audio input levels

**API Errors**
- Verify OpenAI API key has sufficient credits
- Check API key permissions for audio and chat endpoints
- Ensure internet connection is stable
- Try different base URL if using alternative provider

**File Size Limits**
- Maximum audio file size: 25MB (OpenAI limit)
- Minimum audio size: 1KB for validation
- Files are automatically validated before transcription
- Long recordings may hit size limits

**Paste/Clipboard Issues**
- Check app permissions for clipboard access
- Try different paste behavior settings
- Verify target application accepts clipboard input
- Use "Show with action buttons" mode for manual control

### Error Messages

- `Sox is not installed`: Install SoX using Homebrew or MacPorts
- `Audio file exceeds 25MB limit`: Recording too long, try shorter sessions
- `OpenAI API key is required`: Configure API key in preferences
- `Transcription failed`: Check API key, credits, and internet connection
- `Audio file is too short`: Ensure minimum 1KB file size
- `Paste Error`: Target application may not accept clipboard input

## Privacy & Security

- Audio files are temporarily stored locally and automatically deleted after 24 hours
- No persistent storage of voice recordings
- API keys are stored securely in Raycast preferences
- All API calls use HTTPS encryption
- No telemetry or usage tracking
- Local processing with external API calls only for transcription/formatting
